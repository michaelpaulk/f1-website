        <h2>Formula 1 Eras</h2>

        <section>
          <h3>1950s: Birth of Formula 1</h3>
          <div class="placeholder">ERA IMAGE</div>
          <p>
            The first official Formula One World Championship began in 1950. 
            Teams such as Alfa Romeo, Maserati, and Ferrari defined the decade with 
            front engine cars, simple aerodynamics, and almost no safety features.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>1960s: Rear Engines and Design Change</h3>
          <div class="placeholder">ERA IMAGE</div>
          <p>
            The switch to rear mounted engines changed the balance and potential of the cars. 
            Teams like Cooper and Lotus led the way, and drivers such as Jim Clark 
            showed what was possible with lighter, more agile machines.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>1970s: Aerodynamics and Ground Effect</h3>
          <div class="placeholder">ERA IMAGE</div>
          <p>
            Wings and underbody design became central to performance. 
            Ground effect cars produced huge cornering speeds, while regulation and safety concerns 
            started to push the sport toward more structured rules.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>1980s: Turbo Power and Electronics</h3>
          <div class="placeholder">ERA IMAGE</div>
          <p>
            Turbocharged engines produced extreme power figures. 
            Teams like McLaren and Williams combined engine strength with early electronic systems 
            to control traction and power delivery.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>1990s: Safety Focus and New Dominance</h3>
          <div class="placeholder">ERA IMAGE</div>
          <p>
            Following major accidents, Formula 1 introduced stronger safety standards. 
            Teams refined reliability and race strategy, and drivers like Michael Schumacher 
            began long runs of success.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>2000s: Consolidation and Reliability</h3>
          <div class="placeholder">ERA IMAGE</div>
          <p>
            Teams focused on reliability, long life engines, and controlled testing. 
            Ferrari and Schumacher set records for titles and race wins, 
            and the sport moved toward cost control and more structured regulations.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>2010s: Hybrid Power Units</h3>
          <div class="placeholder">ERA IMAGE</div>
          <p>
            Hybrid V6 turbo power units arrived, linking performance with energy recovery systems. 
            Mercedes understood the new rules best and built a long period of dominance.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>2020s: Return of Ground Effect</h3>
          <div class="placeholder">ERA IMAGE</div>
          <p>
            New rules focused on closer racing through simplified bodywork and ground effect floors. 
            Red Bull and Max Verstappen adapted quickly, while cost caps reshaped how teams operate.

      <!-- CIRCUITS SECTION -->
      <section id="circuits">
        <h2>Iconic Circuits</h2>
        <p>
          Formula 1 travels to a wide range of circuits. Some are classic permanent tracks, 
          others are temporary street layouts. Below are a few examples that often define the character of a season.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Monaco</h3>
          <div class="placeholder">CIRCUIT IMAGE</div>
          <p>
            A tight street circuit with very low margins for error. 
            Overtaking is rare, so qualifying and track position are critical.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Monza</h3>
          <div class="placeholder">CIRCUIT IMAGE</div>
          <p>
            Known as the Temple of Speed. Long straights and heavy braking zones 
            reward low drag setups and stable braking performance.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Suzuka</h3>
          <div class="placeholder">CIRCUIT IMAGE</div>
          <p>
            A classic figure eight layout with fast, flowing corners. 
            It is often used as a reference for balanced car performance.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Las Vegas</h3>
          <div class="placeholder">CIRCUIT IMAGE</div>
          <p>
            A modern street layout built around long straights and low ambient temperatures. 
            Tire warm up and safety car timing play a major role in race outcomes.
