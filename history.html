        <h2>Origins of Formula 1</h2>
        <p>
          The Formula 1 world championship began in 1950, built on the tradition of European Grand Prix racing.
          Early races were held on long, dangerous road circuits and airfield layouts, with minimal safety and
          cars that were fast but fragile. The focus was on mechanical grip, naturally aspirated engines, and
          drivers who were as much daredevils as athletes.

        <h2>Ground Effect and Turbo Power</h2>
        <p>
          In the late seventies and eighties, engineers pushed aerodynamics and engine power to extremes.
          Ground effect cars generated huge cornering forces with sculpted floors, while turbocharged engines
          produced qualifying power well beyond what drivers could use comfortably in race trim.
          This era created some of the most aggressive driving and intense rivalries in the sport.

        <h2>Safety, Professionalism, and the Modern Era</h2>
        <p>
          From the nineties onward, safety standards improved dramatically. Circuits were redesigned,
          cars became stronger, and medical response improved. At the same time, teams grew into complex
          organizations with hundreds of staff, dedicated simulators, and full time data analysis.
          The sport shifted from heroic improvisation to relentless preparation and marginal gains.

      <section class="panel">
        <h2>Hybrid Power and Data Driven Racing</h2>
        <p>
          The current era centers on hybrid power units, energy recovery systems, and heavy reliance on
          simulation tools. Drivers manage tires, battery deployment, and fuel usage while racing flat out,
          and teams make decisions based on live telemetry and scenario modeling. It is still the same
          core idea as 1950, though: build the fastest car you can, and find a driver who can handle it.

        <h2>Classic Footage</h2>
        <p>
          This section highlights vintage race clips and moments associated with legends such as Jim Clark
          and Ayrton Senna. The goal is to show how car behavior, circuit design, and driving style have
          evolved while the basic tension of risk and reward has stayed the same.
