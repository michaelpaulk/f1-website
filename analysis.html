        <h2>Las Vegas Grand Prix 2025 – Street Circuit Survival</h2>
        <p>
          The Las Vegas Grand Prix combined low track temperatures with long straights and heavy braking zones.
          Teams that could keep tire temperatures in the right window without destroying the fronts were able
          to control the race pace. McLaren looked strong in clean air, but repeated safety cars and traffic
          put them on the wrong side of track position. Red Bull’s decision to stay out longer on the first
          stint gave them the flexibility to respond to the final neutralization and protect a late lead.

        <h2>Belgian Grand Prix 2025 – Spa and Mixed Conditions</h2>
        <p>
          At Spa, the forecast never truly settled, which kept strategy wide open. Early on, several mid field
          teams gambled on a switch to slicks while a portion of the grid stayed on intermediates. The crossover
          point arrived one or two laps earlier than expected, so the undercut was powerful for anyone who moved
          first. The front runners had to manage sector two carefully in damp patches, which gave brave drivers
          a chance to overtake through Les Combes and into Pouhon. A late safety car compressed the pack and
          turned the end of the race into a straight fight on equal tires.

        <h2>Japanese Grand Prix 2025 – Suzuka’s High Speed Balance</h2>
        <p>
          Suzuka rewarded cars with a strong front end and predictable rotation through the first sector.
          Teams trimmed rear wing to gain speed for the run from 130R to the chicane, but the real lap time
          came from stability in the Esses. Drivers who could commit early to turn in without fighting the
          rear of the car built tire temperature cleanly and saved their rubber for the second half of the
          stint. Strategy centered on a two stop plan, with most teams trying to avoid getting stuck in
          dirty air after the first round of stops.

        <h2>Brazilian Grand Prix 2025 – Interlagos and Tire Deg</h2>
        <p>
          Interlagos once again highlighted how quickly a race can swing with changing cloud cover.
          When the track cooled, the high degradation on the left side tires eased and undercut attempts
          became less effective. Teams that committed to an early two stop strategy sometimes found
          themselves forced into a third stop when traffic ruined their middle stint. The winning approach
          balanced short aggressive runs with enough margin to defend on older tires in the final laps,
          especially on the climb from Juncao to the main straight.

        <h2>How This Analysis Works</h2>
        <p>
          Each summary focuses on a few core factors: track layout, tire behavior, weather, and strategy.
          The goal is not to rewrite the entire race, but to explain why certain teams and drivers rose
          to the front while others faded.
